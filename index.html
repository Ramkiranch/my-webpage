Various validations were written for the various fields in the form to avoid invalid data. PHP is used as server-side scripting with HTML and CSS in the front end. MySQL is the database used. The project was developed in the Ubuntu OS and hence LAMPP is used for starting Apache and MySQL services. But it was deployed on the windows machine and hence XAMPP is used to start both the services. As the input data is sensitive PHI information, the web page is only deployed locally and used by monitoring and evaluation manager</p>
